# Exercise 11: Learn GitHub - Branch and Merge

## Instructions

* Fork this repo (original repo) to your GitHub account.
* Clone the forked repo to your local machine.
* On your local machine:
  * Create a new branch using `git checkout -b YOUR_STUDENT_ID` (replace YOUR_STUDENT_ID with your actual student ID).
  * Answer the questions below by editing this `README.md` file. You may refer to course materials but may NOT copy from other students.
  * After answering all questions, commit your changes.
  * Run the command `git log --oneline > YOUR_STUDENT_ID.log` to save your commit history to a file named with your student ID.
  * Add this log file to Git and commit this addition to your branch.
  * Switch to main branch using `git checkout main`, then merge your branch using `git merge YOUR_STUDENT_ID`. Do NOT delete your branch after merging.
  * Push all changes to your remote repo on GitHub.
* On GitHub:
  * Create a pull request (PR) to the original repo
  * Use **YOUR_STUDENT_ID** as the PR title
  * Submit by **Friday Febuary 27, 2024 1:00pm (GMT+7)**.
  * Leave the PR open after submission.
* Your PR must include the following:
  * Your answers of all questions.
  * Your commit history log file (`YOUR_STUDENT_ID.log`).
  * Note: Late submissions or PRs not visible in the original repo will NOT be graded.

## Questions

1. Name two Linux commands from this course that you found most valuable. For each:
   * Briefly describe its function
   * Explain why it's essential for new engineers (in your own words)

**Answer:** 
  The "ls" command is used to display the list of files and directories in the current working directory. It helps users quickly see the contents of a folder and understand its structure.
  In my opinion, "ls" is one of the most fundamental commands for new engineers because it allows us to navigate and verify project files efficiently. When working on shared repositories or remote servers, being able to quickly check available files is extremely important. It helps prevent mistakes such as editing or deleting the wrong file.
  
  The "cd" command is used to change the current working directory. It allows users to move between folders within the file system.
  I believe "cd" is essential because most development tasks involve working in multiple directories. Whether we are managing project files, accessing configuration folders, or using Git, we constantly switch between directories. Mastering this command improves efficiency and helps us better understand how file systems are organized.

2. After one and a half years in the ISNE program, what advice would you give to prospective ISNE students? (Minimum 50 words)

**Answer:** 
After studying in the ISNE program for one and a half years, I would advise prospective students to be prepared for both theoretical and practical challenges. The courses require consistent effort, especially in programming, networking, and system-related subjects. Regular practice is very important, as technical skills improve through hands-on experience rather than passive learning.
Time management is also crucial because multiple assignments and projects may overlap. I strongly recommend practicing Linux and Git regularly, as they are widely used in many subjects and are valuable skills for future careers. Lastly, do not hesitate to ask questions and collaborate with classmates. Teamwork and communication skills are just as important as technical knowledge in this field.
